# About

As a part of my Consultation and Communication for Statisticians course (STAT 4893W), we were tasked with completing a statistical consultation for Dr. Nguyen-Feng, an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. Our objective was to determine whether or not a relashionship exists between compassion fatigue of Trauma Center Trauma Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) facilitators and the coping strategies they employed. In doing so, I implemented various statistical methods including Multiple Linear Regression, Regression Trees, Bagging, and Cluster Analysis for coping strategy categorization. 

This repository includes my statistical analysis conducted in R Studio, the TCTSY dataset, and my written report.

Below is the abstract for my written report to give you a better idea of the process and results of this project. Thanks!

## Abstract

Using data provided by Dr. Nguyen-Feng, our statistical research will focus on coping strategies and compassion fatigue of TCTSY’F’s. Our objective is to determine whether a statistically significant relationship exists between compassion fatigue of TCTSY-F’s and the coping strategies they employ. Our study implemented two linear regression models for each compassion fatigue variable (job burnout and secondary trauma) while using coping strategies as covariates. We converted our coefficients in the model to beta coefficients, which are commonly used in psychology. We implemented bagging regression trees as another form of analysis to determine the importance of each coping strategy in the models. Ultimately, we were not able to make statistically significant conclusions on our regression model, as beta coefficients are outside of the realm of statistical analysis, but we were able to make distinctions between our covariates using cluster analysis, as well as our observations using k-means clustering.
